# Javascript Bedlam
>A resource for cutting through the chaos JavaScript development

__ATTENTION: This course is still in pre-development. Use appropriate caution.__

## Introduction
In recent years, JavaScript has grown from a somewhat obscure and flawed mechanism of interacting with web browsers into one of the most diverse programming ecosystems that have ever existed. With the popularity of the web, interest in the language has exploded, and the landscape of libraries, modules, framworks and tools has expanded beyond anyone's expectations.

## Structure
We'll be splitting this workshop into ** individual workshops that will be accompanied by readings and, in some cases, problem sets. While this course has been organized in this manner and undesrstanding people's different backgrounds and experience, you should self-evalutate the amount of rigour you put into each section.

| Prefix | Workshop          | Time |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| 0      | [Getting Started](/0_getting_started.md)   | 0:25 |
| 1      | [Javascript Basics](/1_javascript_basics.md) | 2:30 |
| 2      | Functions         |      |
